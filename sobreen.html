            <p id="histcd">CDs (Compact Discs) revolutionized the music industry in the 1980s. Developed by Philips and Sony, they were launched in 1982 with ABBA's album "The Visitors". CDs offered high-quality audio and durability. They had a capacity of 74-80 minutes of music and led record companies to re-release their catalogs on CD. Over time, additional features emerged, such as CD-Text and CD+G, and rewritable formats, such as CD-R and CD-RW.
                However, as digital music became more popular, CD sales declined starting in the 2000s with the rise of streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. Although still prized by collectors, CDs have lost their dominant position as the primary music distribution format. Its story represents a milestone in the evolution of music technology.</p>
